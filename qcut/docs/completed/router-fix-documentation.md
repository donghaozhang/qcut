# Router Fix Documentation

## Issue Description
The TanStack Router is failing to mount properly in the Electron environment, specifically when navigating to the editor route (when clicking "new project" button). The error occurs:

```
Uncaught Error: invariant expected app router to be mounted
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Hash History Issues**: The hash history router may not be properly initialized in Electron's `file://` protocol environment
2. **Route Navigation**: The editor route with dynamic parameters (`/editor/$project_id`) is causing mounting issues
3. **Component Lifecycle**: The router may be trying to mount before the DOM is fully ready

## Current Fix Attempts

### 1. Lazy Router Initialization
- Implemented lazy loading of router instance
- Added DOM readiness checks before router initialization
- Used `useState` and `useEffect` to ensure proper timing

### 2. Error Boundary Implementation
- Added error boundary to root route for better error handling
- Provides fallback UI when router fails

### 3. Suspense Wrapper
- Wrapped RouterProvider in React.Suspense for better loading states

## Solution: Memory History Implementation

Memory history is the most reliable approach for Electron applications as it eliminates file:// protocol conflicts and provides better stability for desktop apps.

### Implementation
```typescript
import { createMemoryHistory } from '@tanstack/react-router'

const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  history: createMemoryHistory({
    initialEntries: ['/'],
  }),
  defaultPreload: 'intent',
  context: {},
})
```

### Advantages
- Most reliable for Electron apps - no dependency on URL fragments or browser history
- Navigation state stored in memory, isolated from file:// protocol issues
- No URL changes visible to user (cleaner for desktop app)
- Eliminates hash/browser history conflicts in Electron environment
- Better performance - no DOM manipulation for URL updates

## Implementation Plan

### Current Status
✅ **COMPLETED**
- `apps/web/src/App.tsx` - Memory history implementation done
- `apps/web/src/routes/__root.tsx` - Error boundary implementation done  
- `apps/web/src/components/header.tsx` - Fixed nested button warnings done

### Remaining Tasks

#### Task 1: Test New Project Button Navigation (2 min)
**File:** `apps/web/src/routes/projects.tsx` (lines 93-95)
**Subtasks:**
1. ✅ Verify navigation syntax is correct for memory history (30s)
2. ✅ Ensure project_id parameter is properly passed (30s)
3. ✅ Build and start Electron app (30s) - Build completed successfully
4. ✅ Electron app launches without build errors - Ready for manual testing

**Status:** READY FOR MANUAL TESTING
- Electron app is built and launching successfully
- Navigation code syntax verified as correct for memory history
- Need to manually click "New Project" button to verify router error is resolved

#### Task 2: Validate Route Parameter Handling (3+ min → Split)

##### Task 2a: Test useParams Hook (1 min)
**File:** `apps/web/src/routes/editor.$project_id.tsx` (line 25)
**Subtasks:**
1. ✅ Add console.log to verify project_id extraction (30s)
2. ✅ Build completed - Ready for testing useParams() functionality

##### Task 2b: Test Project Loading Logic (2 min)  
**File:** `apps/web/src/routes/editor.$project_id.tsx` (lines 83-135)
**Subtasks:**
1. ✅ Added console.log for loadProject() function testing (30s)
2. ✅ Added console.log for createNewProject() fallback testing (30s) 
3. ✅ Added console.log for navigation to new project_id (30s)
4. ✅ Added console.log for error handling testing (30s)

**Status:** READY FOR TESTING
- Console logs added to track:
  - Route parameter extraction: `[Task 2a] Route.useParams() project_id:`
  - Project loading: `[Task 2b] Attempting to load project:` and `[Task 2b] Project loaded successfully:`
  - New project creation: `[Task 2b] Project not found, creating new project:` and `[Task 2b] New project created successfully:`
  - Navigation: `[Task 2b] Navigating to new project:`
  - Error handling: `[Task 2b] Recoverable error, not creating new project:`

##### Task 2c: Test Editor Component Rendering (1 min)
**File:** `apps/web/src/routes/editor.$project_id.tsx` (lines 150-224)
**Subtasks:**
1. ⏳ Verify EditorProvider initializes correctly (30s)
2. ⏳ Test that all editor panels render without errors (30s)

#### Task 3: Test Basic Navigation (5+ min → Split)

##### Task 3a: Test Static Routes (2 min)
**Files:** Home, Blog, Contributors pages
**Subtasks:**
1. ⏳ Test home page navigation (30s)
2. ⏳ Test blog page navigation (30s)
3. ⏳ Test contributors page navigation (30s)
4. ⏳ Test back/forward between static pages (30s)

##### Task 3b: Test Dynamic Routes (2 min)
**Files:** Editor, Blog post pages
**Subtasks:**
1. ⏳ Test editor route with different project_ids (30s)
2. ⏳ Test blog post route with different slugs (30s)
3. ⏳ Test invalid parameter handling (30s)
4. ⏳ Test navigation between dynamic routes (30s)

##### Task 3c: Test Navigation Edge Cases (1 min)
**Subtasks:**
1. ⏳ Test rapid navigation clicks (20s)
2. ⏳ Test navigation during loading states (20s)
3. ⏳ Test navigation with async operations (20s)

### Files Modified
- ✅ `apps/web/src/App.tsx` - Switched to memory history
- ✅ `apps/web/src/routes/__root.tsx` - Added error boundary
- ✅ `apps/web/src/components/header.tsx` - Fixed nested buttons

## Testing Notes
- The router works for basic navigation (home, blog, contributors)
- Issue specifically occurs when clicking "New Project" button
- Error suggests the router is trying to navigate before being fully mounted

## Priority
This is a HIGH priority issue as it blocks the core functionality of creating new projects and accessing the video editor.
