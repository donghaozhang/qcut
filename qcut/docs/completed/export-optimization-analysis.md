# Export Performance Optimization Analysis

## Current Performance Status

### Implemented Optimizations ✅
1. **Video seek timeout**: 1000ms → Adaptive (50-200ms)
2. **Frame delays**: 100ms → 40ms total  
3. **Canvas verification**: Every frame → Every 10th frame
4. **Video element caching**: Prevents re-loading same videos
5. **Adaptive timeout system**: Based on video duration & seek distance
6. **Progressive canvas quality**: Fast preview vs high-quality final

### Current Performance Estimate
- **Per frame time**: ~70-120ms (down from ~1116ms)
- **1-second video (30 fps)**: ~2.1-3.6 seconds
- **Export ratio**: 2.1-3.6x video duration (target: 0.5x)

## Task 3 Analysis: Smart Frame Skipping ❌

### Issues Found:
```typescript
// BUG in proposed code:
const skipFrames = this.settings.quality === 'preview' ? 2 : 0;
// Should be:
const skipFrames = this.settings.purpose === ExportPurpose.PREVIEW ? 2 : 0;
```

### Recommendation: **NOT NECESSARY**
**Reasons**:
1. Frame skipping could miss rendering issues (black frames)
2. MediaRecorder needs consistent frame input for smooth video
3. We already optimized preview mode with canvas quality
4. Better to optimize frame processing than skip frames

### Alternative Approach:
If preview speed is still an issue, consider:
- Reduce resolution for preview (480p instead of selected quality)
- Use lower video bitrate for preview
- Process in larger chunks (every 5 frames instead of every frame)

## Task 4 Analysis: Parallel Video Pre-loading ✅

### Implementation Value: **HIGH**
**Benefits**:
1. Eliminates video loading delays during export
2. Videos load in parallel instead of sequentially
3. First frame renders immediately without wait
4. Minimal memory impact (already caching)

### Performance Impact:
- **Current**: Each unique video loads on first use (~100-500ms)
- **With pre-loading**: 0ms delay during export
- **Estimated savings**: 200-1000ms total depending on video count

### Recommended Implementation:
```typescript
// Call before starting export loop
await this.preloadAllVideos();
console.log(`[ExportEngine] Pre-loaded ${this.videoCache.size} videos`);

// Then start normal export process
for (let frame = 0; frame < totalFrames; frame++) {
  // Videos already loaded, no delays
}
```

## Task 5 Analysis: Memory-Efficient Pixel Sampling ✅

### Implementation Value: **MEDIUM**
**Current Issue**:
- Checking 854×480 = 409,920 pixels × 4 channels = 1,639,680 operations
- Running every 10 frames is still ~164K operations per check

**Optimization**:
- Sample every 10th pixel reduces to 16.4K operations
- 10x faster with minimal accuracy loss
- Still catches fully black frames

### Recommendation: **IMPLEMENT**
Simple change with good performance benefit.

## Priority Recommendations

### Implement Now (High Impact, Low Effort):
1. ✅ **Task 4**: Parallel Video Pre-loading (saves 200-1000ms)
2. ✅ **Task 5**: Pixel Sampling (10x faster checks)

### Skip or Defer:
1. ❌ **Task 3**: Frame Skipping (problematic, not needed)

### Consider for Future:
1. **Resolution reduction for preview**: Export at 480p for preview regardless of quality setting
2. **Batch frame processing**: Process multiple frames before updating progress
3. **Smart caching**: Pre-calculate video seek positions

## Expected Final Performance

With Task 4 & 5 implemented:
- **1-second video**: ~1.5-2 seconds (down from 3+ seconds)
- **5-second video**: ~7-10 seconds (down from 15+ seconds)  
- **Export ratio**: 1.5-2x video duration (closer to 0.5x target)

## Next Steps

1. Implement Task 4 (Video Pre-loading) - 5 minutes
2. Implement Task 5 (Pixel Sampling) - 3 minutes
3. Test with various video lengths
4. Consider WebWorker if still not meeting targets
