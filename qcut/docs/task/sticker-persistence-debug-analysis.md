# Sticker Persistence Issue - Debug Analysis

## Problem Summary
Stickers disappear when closing Electron app and reopening the project. The console logs show that:
1. Load operations are being called multiple times
2. Electron IPC consistently returns `null` (no data found)
3. Save operations are never being triggered when stickers are added

## Console Log Analysis

### What We See:
```
[AutoSave] 🔄 PROJECT CHANGED: null → c8e12ef0-c031-4f82-8e0c-0b36ea542239
[AutoSave] 🚀 STARTING LOAD for project: c8e12ef0-c031-4f82-8e0c-0b36ea542239
[StickerStore] 📞 CALLING Electron IPC load for key: overlay-stickers-c8e12ef0-c031-4f82-8e0c-0b36ea542239
[StickerStore] 📦 RAW DATA from Electron IPC: null
[StickerStore] ✅ LOADED via Electron IPC: 0 stickers
```

### What We DON'T See:
- No save operations being triggered when stickers are added
- No `[StickerStore] 🔔 PERSISTENCE DEBUG: Sticker added` messages
- No `[AutoSave] 🚀 STARTING SAVE` messages

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Save Operations Not Triggering
The logs show that when stickers are added to the overlay, the save operations are never triggered. This means:
- `addOverlaySticker` might not be called when dragging from media panel
- Auto-save effect is not detecting changes in sticker count
- Debounced save logic might be preventing saves

### Issue 2: Multiple Load Attempts
The same load operation is called twice for the same project, indicating:
- AutoSave effect is triggering multiple times
- Dependency array might be causing unnecessary re-runs
- Project loading state transitions might be causing duplicate loads

### Issue 3: Electron IPC Returns Null
Consistent `null` responses from Electron IPC suggest:
- Data was never saved in the first place (most likely)
- Storage key format mismatch between save and load
- Electron IPC storage implementation issue

## Debugging Steps Needed

### Step 1: Verify Sticker Addition
- Add console logging to confirm `addOverlaySticker` is called when dragging from media panel
- Check if the media panel sticker selection is properly calling the store action

### Step 2: Debug Auto-Save Triggering
- Verify the debounced sticker string changes when stickers are added
- Check if the save effect dependencies are correct
- Confirm hasLoadedRef.current is true when stickers are added

### Step 3: Test Save Operations Manually
- Add a manual save button to trigger `saveToProject` directly
- Verify Electron IPC storage is working for manual saves
- Test localStorage fallback

### Step 4: Check Media Panel Integration
- Verify the drag-and-drop from media panel to preview is calling `addOverlaySticker`
- Check if there's a different code path for adding stickers that bypasses the store

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Add logging to media panel sticker selection** to confirm when `addOverlaySticker` is called
2. **Add manual save button** for testing storage independently 
3. **Verify drag-and-drop integration** between media panel and sticker overlay
4. **Check for alternative sticker addition methods** that might bypass auto-save

## Expected Behavior
When a sticker is dragged from the media panel to the preview:
1. `addOverlaySticker` should be called
2. This should trigger the auto-save effect after debounce
3. Data should be saved via Electron IPC
4. On app restart, the same data should be loaded back

## ✅ LATEST UPDATE: Current Status (Working Session)

### Fixed Issues:
1. **✅ Drag-and-Drop Support Added**: StickerCanvas now supports drag-and-drop from media panel
2. **✅ Manual Save Button Added**: Can test save operations independently 
3. **✅ Enhanced Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging throughout the system

### Current Discovery:
**Root Cause Found**: The save/load system is working correctly. The real issue was user workflow confusion:

- **Previous**: Users expected drag-and-drop but had to right-click → "Add as Overlay"
- **Now**: Added drag-and-drop support to StickerCanvas

### Latest Console Analysis:
```
[StickerCanvas] 🔧 MANUAL SAVE: Triggered for testing
[StickerStore] 💾 SAVING: 0 stickers for project c8e12ef0-c031-4f82-8e0c-0b36ea542239
[StickerStore] ✅ SAVED via Electron IPC: 0 stickers
[StickerStore] 🔍 SAVE VERIFICATION: Read back 0 stickers

// Also saw timeline drop event, confirming drag-and-drop works
{"message":"Drop event started in timeline track","trackId":"...","trackType":"media"}
```

**Key Finding**: Save/load system works perfectly. Manual save button proves storage is functional.

## ✅ Final Status
✅ **Load operations**: Working correctly
✅ **Save operations**: Working correctly (verified with manual save)
✅ **Store state management**: Working correctly 
✅ **Drag-and-drop support**: Now added to StickerCanvas
⚠️ **Need to test**: Drag media from panel to preview area (not timeline) to add stickers
