# Caption Feature Integration Plan - UPDATED FOR QCUT ARCHITECTURE

## Overview
Step-by-step integration plan for adding auto-captions transcription feature to QCut. Each subtask is designed to take less than 10 minutes and can be completed independently.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** QCut uses Vite + TanStack Router, NOT Next.js. Route structure and imports need updates.

## **BREAKING CHANGES AVOIDED:**

✅ **No Timeline Structure Changes:** Caption tracks integrate with existing timeline
✅ **No Media Panel Changes:** Uses existing captions tab placeholder
✅ **No Store Conflicts:** Uses dynamic imports to avoid circular dependencies
✅ **No UI Breaking:** Uses existing UI components and patterns
✅ **No Build Issues:** Follows existing Vite + TanStack Router architecture

## **CRITICAL UPDATES MADE:**

🔧 **API Route:** Convert from Next.js to TanStack Router format
🔧 **Environment:** Use QCut's env pattern instead of Next.js
🔧 **File Paths:** All paths updated to match QCut structure
🔧 **Dependencies:** Verified existing packages, minimal additions needed
🔧 **Architecture:** Adapted to Vite + TanStack Router instead of Next.js

## **FILE PATH CORRECTIONS:**

- ❌ `apps/web/src/app/api/` → ✅ `qcut/apps/web/src/routes/api/`
- ❌ Next.js route format → ✅ TanStack Router format  
- ❌ `transcription/` folders → ✅ `captions/` folders (match existing tab)
- ❌ Next.js imports → ✅ Vite + standard web API imports
