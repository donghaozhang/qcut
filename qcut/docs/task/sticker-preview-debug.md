# Sticker Preview Not Working - Debug Investigation

## Issue Description
**Problem**: Sticker preview is not working after opening the project. This is a recurring issue that happens each time the project is loaded.

**Symptoms**:
- Sticker preview fails to display
- Issue occurs consistently on project open
- Complex issue requiring systematic debugging

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis
- [ ] Check sticker store initialization
- [ ] Verify sticker data persistence
- [ ] Analyze component mounting order
- [ ] Review console errors on project load

### Phase 2: State Management
- [ ] Investigate sticker store state after project load
- [ ] Check if stickers data is properly restored
- [ ] Verify sticker selection hooks
- [ ] Test sticker store reactivity

### Phase 3: Rendering Pipeline
- [ ] Check sticker canvas initialization
- [ ] Verify preview component mounting
- [ ] Test sticker image loading
- [ ] Analyze preview panel state

### Phase 4: Integration Testing
- [ ] Test sticker preview in development mode
- [ ] Test sticker preview in production build
- [ ] Verify cross-component communication
- [ ] Check for race conditions

## Debug Checklist

### Console Logs to Monitor
```javascript
// Add these console logs for debugging
console.log('[STICKER DEBUG] Store initialized:', useStickersStore.getState())
console.log('[STICKER DEBUG] Preview component mounted')
console.log('[STICKER DEBUG] Canvas ready:', canvasRef.current)
console.log('[STICKER DEBUG] Selected sticker:', selectedSticker)
```

### Key Files to Investigate
- `src/stores/stickers-store.ts` - Main sticker state management
- `src/components/editor/stickers/` - Sticker components
- `src/hooks/use-stickers.ts` - Sticker hooks
- `src/routes/editor.$project_id.tsx` - Editor initialization

### Potential Root Causes
1. **State Persistence**: Sticker store not properly restored on project load
2. **Component Lifecycle**: Preview components mounting before data is ready
3. **Canvas Issues**: Canvas not properly initialized for sticker rendering
4. **Race Conditions**: Async operations completing out of order
5. **Storage Issues**: Problems with sticker data storage/retrieval

### Debug Session Log
*Document findings here during investigation*

**Session 1** - [Date]:

## Resolution Steps
*To be filled as solutions are identified*

1. [ ] Identify root cause
2. [ ] Implement fix
3. [ ] Test fix in dev environment
4. [ ] Test fix in production build
5. [ ] Verify no regressions
6. [ ] Update documentation

## Notes
- This is a complex issue requiring systematic approach
- Multiple components and systems involved
- May require debugging across state management, rendering, and storage layers
