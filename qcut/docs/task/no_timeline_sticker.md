# Sticker Timeline Issues - Critical Bug Report

## Problem Overview

After loading a project, stickers are experiencing critical timeline management issues that break their functionality.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Stickers Broken After Project Load
- **Symptom**: Stickers become non-functional after project reload
- **Impact**: Previously saved stickers lose their interactive capabilities
- **Severity**: High - affects project persistence and user workflow

### 2. Missing Dedicated Sticker Timeline
- **Current State**: Stickers lack a separate timeline track for management
- **Expected Behavior**: When a sticker is dragged to the preview area, it should create/appear in a dedicated sticker timeline
- **User Experience Impact**: 
  - No visual representation of sticker timing on timeline
  - No way to adjust sticker start/end times via timeline
  - Difficult to manage multiple stickers temporally

## Technical Analysis

### Root Causes
1. **Timeline Integration Gap**: The sticker overlay system operates independently from the main timeline, causing synchronization issues
2. **Persistence Layer Mismatch**: Project loading may not properly restore sticker timeline data
3. **Missing Timeline Track Component**: No dedicated UI component for sticker timeline management

### Current Architecture Issues
```
Current Flow:
Drag Sticker ’ Preview Canvas ’ Overlay Store
                              “
                         No Timeline Track

Expected Flow:
Drag Sticker ’ Preview Canvas ’ Overlay Store
                              “
                         Timeline Track Creation
```

## Proposed Solutions

### Phase 1: Timeline Integration (Critical)
1. **Create Sticker Timeline Track Component**
   - Add `StickerTimelineTrack` component
   - Integrate with existing timeline system
   - Display sticker duration and timing

2. **Update Timeline Store**
   - Add sticker track management
   - Synchronize with sticker overlay store
   - Handle sticker timing updates

### Phase 2: Project Persistence Fix
1. **Audit Loading Process**
   - Debug project load sequence for stickers
   - Ensure proper restoration of sticker timeline data
   - Fix any timing synchronization issues

2. **Enhance Storage Layer**
   - Store sticker timeline information alongside overlay data
   - Implement proper loading validation
   - Add error recovery for corrupted sticker data

### Phase 3: User Experience Improvements
1. **Visual Timeline Representation**
   - Show sticker thumbnails on timeline
   - Display sticker names/types
   - Enable drag-to-resize for timing adjustments

2. **Timeline Controls**
   - Add sticker-specific timeline controls
   - Implement bulk sticker operations
   - Support timeline-based sticker selection

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate (P0)
- [ ] Fix project load sticker restoration
- [ ] Create basic sticker timeline track

### High Priority (P1) 
- [ ] Implement sticker timeline synchronization
- [ ] Add drag-to-preview ’ timeline integration

### Medium Priority (P2)
- [ ] Enhanced timeline controls for stickers
- [ ] Sticker timing visualization improvements

## Technical Requirements

### Components Needed
- `StickerTimelineTrack.tsx` - Dedicated timeline track for stickers
- `StickerTimelineItem.tsx` - Individual sticker representations on timeline
- Timeline integration hooks for sticker management

### Store Updates
- Extend timeline store to handle sticker tracks
- Add sticker-timeline synchronization logic
- Implement proper persistence for sticker timeline data

### Testing Requirements
- Project load/save with stickers
- Drag sticker ’ timeline creation flow
- Multiple sticker timing management

## User Impact

### Current Broken Experience
1. User creates project with stickers 
2. Saves project   
3. Reloads project L (stickers broken)
4. Cannot manage sticker timing via timeline L

### Target Fixed Experience
1. User creates project with stickers 
2. Drags sticker ’ appears in preview AND timeline 
3. Saves project 
4. Reloads project  (all stickers functional)
5. Can adjust sticker timing via timeline 

## Next Steps

1. **Investigation Phase**
   - Debug current project loading process
   - Identify exact failure points for stickers
   - Document current timeline architecture

2. **Development Phase** 
   - Implement sticker timeline track component
   - Add timeline-overlay store synchronization
   - Fix project persistence issues

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Test project load/save cycles with stickers
   - Validate timeline interaction with stickers
   - Ensure proper timing management
