## Project Structure

- `apps/web/` â€“ Main Vite + React application (migrated from Next.js)
- `electron/` â€“ Electron main process and preload scripts
- `src/components/` â€“ UI and editor components
- `src/hooks/` â€“ Custom React hooks including Electron integration
- `src/lib/` â€“ Utility and API logic including FFmpeg
- `src/stores/` â€“ State management (Zustand, etc.)
- `src/types/` â€“ TypeScript types including Electron APIs
- `src/routes/` â€“ TanStack Router file-based routing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) - Package manager and bundler
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - For cloning the repository

> **Note:** The Windows desktop app runs completely offline and doesn't require Docker, databases, or external services. Just Node.js and Bun are sufficient for building and running the Electron application.

### Quick Start (Windows Desktop App)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OpenCut-app/OpenCut.git
   cd QCut
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Build the Vite application:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   bun run build
   ```

4. **Run the Electron desktop app:**
   ```bash
   cd ../..  # Back to project root
   bun run electron
   ```

   **Or use this single command to build and run:**
   ```bash
   cd "apps/web" && bun run build && cd .. && npx electron .
   ```

The QCut desktop application will launch with the complete video editing interface!

## Development Setup

### Desktop App Development

For developing the Electron desktop application:

1. **Start the Vite development server:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   bun run dev
   ```
   The dev server will start at `http://localhost:5174`

2. **In another terminal, run Electron in development mode:**
   ```bash
   cd ..  # Back to project root
   NODE_ENV=development bun run electron
   ```

This will launch Electron with hot reload capabilities for development.

### Available Scripts

From the project root:
- `bun run electron` - Run the Electron app in production mode
- `NODE_ENV=development bun run electron` - Run Electron in development mode

From `apps/web/`:
- `bun run dev` - Start Vite development server
- `bun run build` - Build the production bundle
- `bun run preview` - Preview the production build

### Building for Distribution

To create a Windows installer:

```bash
# Build the web app
cd apps/web
bun run build

# Return to root and build Windows installer
cd ../..
bun run dist:win
```

> **Note:** The installer will be created in the `dist-electron/` directory.

## Architecture

QCut uses a modern desktop application stack:

- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TanStack Router
- **Desktop**: Electron with secure IPC communication
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg via WebAssembly
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark theme
- **State Management**: Zustand stores
- **File System**: Native Electron file dialogs and operations

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! The project has been successfully migrated to a desktop-first architecture.

**ðŸŽ¯ Current focus areas:** 
- Timeline functionality and performance
- Native desktop features (menus, shortcuts, file associations)
- Video processing optimizations
- UI/UX improvements for desktop workflow

**âœ… Completed:**
- âœ… Full migration from Next.js to Vite + Electron
- âœ… Native file system integration
- âœ… TanStack Router implementation
- âœ… FFmpeg WebAssembly integration
- âœ… Production-ready Windows desktop build

**Quick start for contributors:**

- Fork the repo and clone locally
- Follow the Quick Start instructions above
- Create a feature branch and submit a PR

## Technical Notes

### Migration from Next.js to Electron

This project was successfully migrated from a Next.js web application to a native Windows desktop application using:

- **Vite** for fast bundling and development
- **TanStack Router** for file-based routing
- **Electron** for native desktop capabilities

Key improvements in the desktop version:
- Faster startup and build times
- Native file system access
- Offline operation
- Better performance for video processing
- No server dependencies
