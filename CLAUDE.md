# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Priority Hierarchy: Long-term maintainability > scalability > performance > short-term gains

## Essential Commands

### Linting & Code Quality
```bash
# Run standard linting (shows all errors including unfixable FFmpeg files)
bun lint

# Run clean linting (skips parse errors from FFmpeg WebAssembly files) - RECOMMENDED
bun lint:clean

# Auto-fix formatting issues
bun format
```

Core Principles:

Systems Thinking: Analyze impacts across entire system
Future-Proofing: Design decisions that accommodate growth
Dependency Management: Minimize coupling, maximize cohesion

frontend: UI/UX and user-facing development

### Code Documentation
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Document API interfaces and types
- Include usage examples for reusable components

## Project Overview

QCut is a desktop video editor built with Vite + TanStack Router + Electron. The project has been successfully migrated from Next.js and now runs as a native desktop application. It uses a monorepo structure with Bun as the package manager.

## Key Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vite 7.0.6, TanStack Router (Hash History), React 19, TypeScript
- **Desktop**: Electron 37.2.5 with IPC handlers for file operations
- **State Management**: Zustand stores (editor-store, timeline-store, project-store)
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg WebAssembly (@ffmpeg/ffmpeg)
- **Storage**: Multi-tier system (Electron IPC → IndexedDB → localStorage fallback)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.1.11
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo with Bun

### Project Structure

```



### Core Editor Architecture
- **Timeline System**: Custom implementation in `src/components/editor/timeline/`
- **State Management**: Multiple Zustand stores for separation of concerns
- **Storage**: Abstraction layer supporting IndexedDB and OPFS
- **Media Processing**: Client-side FFmpeg with WebAssembly

## Development Commands

### Root Level
```bash
bun dev          # Start all apps in development
bun build        # Build all packages and apps
bun check-types  # Type checking across workspace
bun lint         # Lint with Ultracite/Biome
bun format       # Format with Ultracite/Biome
```

### Web App (apps/web/)
```bash
bun dev                  # Vite dev server (port 5173)
bun build                # Production build
bun lint:fix             # Auto-fix linting issues
```

### Database Setup
```bash
# Docker services required:
docker-compose up -d     # PostgreSQL (5432), Redis (6379)
```

## Electron Build & Distribution

### Development
```bash
bun run electron         # Run Electron app (production mode)
bun run electron:dev     # Run Electron app (development mode)
```

### Building EXE
```bash
# Option 1: Using electron-packager (recommended)
npx electron-packager . QCut --platform=win32 --arch=x64 --out=dist-packager --overwrite

# Option 2: Using electron-builder (if configured)
bun run dist:win
```
## Important Patterns

### State Management
```typescript
// Zustand stores in src/stores/
useEditorStore()    // Main editor state
useTimelineStore()  // Timeline operations
useProjectStore()   // Project management
usePlaybackStore()  // Video playback
```

### Storage Abstraction
```typescript
// src/lib/storage/
StorageService with IndexedDBAdapter or OPFSAdapter
```

### Timeline Components
- `TimelineTrack` - Individual tracks
- `TimelineElement` - Media elements on timeline
- `TimelinePlayhead` - Current position indicator

## Environment Variables
```bash
DATABASE_URL            # PostgreSQL connection
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET      # Authentication
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL  # Redis for rate limiting
MARBLE_WORKSPACE_KEY    # Blog CMS
```

## Code Style
- **Linting**: Biome with Ultracite configuration
- **Many lint rules disabled** - be aware when adding new code
- **Path aliases**: Use `@/` for `src/` imports

## Testing
**⚠️ No testing framework currently configured** - This is a known gap

## Key Files to Understand
- `apps/web/src/routes/editor.$project_id.tsx` - Main editor entry
- `apps/web/src/stores/timeline-store.ts` - Timeline state logic
- `apps/web/src/lib/ffmpeg-utils.ts` - Video processing
- `apps/web/src/components/editor/timeline/` - Timeline UI components

# QCut – Top 10 Accessibility Rules to Always Enforce

These ten rules catch the most frequent and most critical a11y bugs in a React + Electron (Chromium) environment. Add them to your lint setup and PR checklist first.

| # | Rule | Why It Matters |
|---|------|----------------|
| **1** | **Provide a meaningful `alt` text for every image/icon that requires it.** | Screen-reader users rely on `alt`; missing or vague descriptions leave them with zero context. |
| **2** | **Never place `aria-hidden="true"` on focusable elements.** | The element is still tabbable, but the assistive tech can’t read it – a dead end for keyboard users. |
| **3** | **Every `<button>` *must* specify `type="button"` or `type="submit"`.** | Avoids accidental form submission and clarifies intent. |
| **4** | **Ensure every `<a>` tag contains meaningful, screen-reader-friendly content and a valid `href`.** | “Empty” or icon-only links announce as “link” with no context or go nowhere. |
| **5** | **If you add `onClick`, also support keyboard (`onKeyDown`/`onKeyUp`).** | Click-only handlers are unusable via keyboard or assistive switches. |
| **6** | **Give every SVG icon a `<title>` element that describes its purpose.** | Without it, readers just announce “graphic” or skip the icon entirely. |
| **7** | **Do not set `tabIndex` on non-interactive elements.** | Arbitrary focus order confuses keyboard navigation and breaks logical flow. |
| **8** | **Use semantic elements instead of roles (`<button>` > `<div role="button">`).** | Native elements come with keyboard focus, states, and ARIA roles out of the box. |
| **9** | **Heading tags (`<h1>` … `<h6>`) must contain real, visible text (not hidden via `aria-hidden`).** | Screen readers rely on the heading hierarchy for quick navigation. |
| **10** | **For every table header `<th>`, set the correct `scope` (“row”, “col”).** | Gives assistive tech enough info to announce the correct header–cell relationship. |

# QCut – Top 5 Code-Complexity & Quality Rules to Enforce First

| # | Rule | Why It Pays Off Immediately |
|---|------|-----------------------------|
| **1** | **Use `for…of` instead of `Array.forEach`.** | `forEach` swallows `await`/`return`, prevents early-exit, and complicates error handling. `for…of` is clearer, supports `break` / `continue`, and works perfectly with `await`. |
| **2** | **Set a Cognitive-Complexity ceiling for every function.** | Stops “God functions” from landing in the codebase; forces decomposition into smaller, testable helpers and keeps reviews manageable. |
| **3** | **Ban the legacy `arguments` object; use rest parameters (`...args`).** | Rest parameters are iterable, type-safe, and compatible with arrow functions—essential for clean TypeScript and better IntelliSense. |
| **4** | **Disallow `any` / `unknown` as type constraints.** | The single biggest source of hidden runtime bugs. Removing it preserves strong typing and makes large-scale refactors safe. |
| **5** | **Forbid reassigning `const` variables and eliminate `var`.** | Guarantees immutability by default, avoids hoisting surprises, and simplifies reasoning about state—especially in asynchronous flows. |

> **Implementation tip:** add these rules to your Ultracite (Biome) config at **error** level first; they deliver the highest value-to-refactor ratio for an existing QCut codebase.


## Current Limitations
1. No test suite
2. Limited error handling
3. No performance monitoring
4. Basic export functionality (needs enhancement)

## When Working on Features
1. Always test both `bun run electron:dev` (development) and `bun run electron` (production)
2. Test EXE builds with `npx electron-packager` after major changes
3. Ensure FFmpeg paths work in both dev and packaged environments
4. Use Electron IPC for all file system operations
